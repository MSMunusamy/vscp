Select appropriate systemd service based on your compile settings. If you
enabled WITH_SYSTEMD, use vscpd.service.notify, otherwise use
vscpd.service.simple. The service must be renamed to vscpd.service
before usage. Don't forget to change default paths in service file if you
changed the default build settings.

With WITH_SYSTEMD vscpd will notify a complete startup after
initialization. This means that follow-up units can be started after full
initialization of vscpd (i.e. sockets are opened).

copy service file to /lib/systemd/system as vscpd.service

Enable with

sysctrl enable vscpd

Start with

sysctrl start vscpd
