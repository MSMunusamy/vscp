# Setting up the system on Rasperry Pi

The [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) is a very nice single board computer and a perfect match for VSCP & Friends. __The VSCP daemon should work on all Raspberry Pi's except the RPi1 with 256 MB memory where the SSL lib fails probably due to out of memory.__ 

If the startup script does not work or if you experience other startup problems you may need to update the firmware of your Raspberry Pi with **rpi-update**

VSCP & Friends has been tested and works very well on Raspberry Pi. 

The setup is the same as on other Unix systems so the instructions to [setup VSCP & Friends on a Linux system](./setting_up_the_system_on_linux.md) can be used.
